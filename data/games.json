Which is a spin off series of the Shin Megami Tensei series. Starting with Persona 3, the series became popular for its combination of traditional RPG mechanics, and social simulation gameplay. By day the player attends high school. By night the game becomes a dungeon crawling turn based RPG. In Persona 4 the player assumes the role of the player-named protagonist who has transferred to a new school in the fictional rural Japanese town of Inaba. The protagonist gains the ability to summon Personas, a power that allows the protagonist to fight Shadows, the enemies of the game. \n \nLike Persona 3, Persona 4 requires the player to manage their time wisely. As most actions in the game will result in time advancing. Passage of time is not based on how long the player takes to do their actions. Once the player has chosen what they will do, time will pass. When time passes it simply skips to the next part of the day. Each day is split into multiple parts: Early Morning, Morning, Lunch, Daytime, Afternoon, After School, and the Evening. Players can choose to spend time with friends, study, read books, fish, and many other side activities. Note that shopping does not cause time to pass. \n \nOn schooldays the player attends school, where there is usually a lecture about random factoids of real life that you will be quizzed on. Getting these questions right or wrong does not effect the main story, but raises the characters Knowledge social stat, which can be used to unlock dialogue options in some cutscenes, and get higher test scores. Other social stats, include: Understanding, Courage, Expression, and Diligence. Each of these stats have many various effects on the players side activities. Some social links require certain levels of social stats. Increasing your social stats can unlock more part time jobs for the player to earn more money. After school and on weekends the player chooses what to do with their free time, \n \nAt night, the player can traverse dungeons. Where they will fight many different types of Shadows. The combat is very similar to any traditional turn based Japanese RPG game. Persona 4 uses a combat system akin to the Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne \"Press Turn\" system. In which the player can take advantage of the enemies weaknesses to gain extra turns. If the player attacks an enemy with an element that enemy is weak to, the player gains an extra turn to attack. However, repeating that attack on the same enemy will not give the character a second extra turn. \n \nThe game features a very complex but easy to use fusing system. The player selects multiple personas to fuse together to create a new persona that can sometimes carry over some of the base personas skills. Later into the game the player can unlock Special Fusions to create Peronas that are very powerful. \n \nSocial Links are one of the key mechanics in this game. Social Links are a measure of the friendship between the protagonist and the many characters of Persona 4. This feature gives your fused Personas bonus experience upon their creation, and allow you to learn new skills and abilities in battle. Social Links also open up romantic relationship options with a few of the games female characters. Social Links play out as the normal cutscenes in the game that provide more character development for the huge cast of characters. There are 24 Social Links in total, each one has a respective Arcana. All Personas have an assigned Arcana. Having a Persona of the same Arcana of a Social Link doubles the rate that you level that Social Link. \n \nPersona 4's plot is closely tied to the weather, thus the player can check the ingame weather forecast. Weather has various effects on the game, on rainy days if the player chooses to study they will gain more Knowledge points than normal. The most essential part of the weather forecast is recognizing when the town will become foggy, as this is an indication of when the player must finish the dungeon they are currently exploring. If the player fails to complete a dungeon before a foggy day the game rolls the calender back one week.

It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a \"boy meets girl\" concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a \"subtracting design\" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.\n\nThe protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles.\n\nIco introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialog, bloom lighting and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards, including \"Game of the Year\" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. Ico is listed on several overall top game lists, and is often considered a work of art. The game was reprinted in Europe in 2006, in conjunction with the release of Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico. Along with Shadow of the Colossus, Ico was released in The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection for the PlayStation 3 which featured high-definition graphics and 3D support.

This is the first title in the series to alter the traditional tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action\" to \"Tactical Espionage Operations\", referring to the base building and mission mechanics of the game. \n \nSet in 1974 in Costa Rica, the game follows the exploits of returning protagonist Big Boss (previously known as Naked Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, now known simply as Snake) as he runs the mercenary unit Militaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Soldiers Without Borders). \n \nPeace Walker consists of two primary playing modes: \"Mission\" and \"Mother Base\". \"Mission\" are the actual action sequences of the game, where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory, whereas \"Mother Base\" is a crew managing simulation mode similar to the \"Comrade System\" in Portable Ops. \n \nMissions \nPlayers get to choose which missions to play from the \"Mission Selector\" screen. There are two main types of Missions: Main Ops are the primary story-based missions in which goals are determined by the narrative and must be played in a strict order in order to proceed. Some Main Ops missions include illustrated cutscenes that involve bits of interactivity in order to proceed. Extra Ops are optional side-missions that involve much more elaborate goals ranging from simple target practices to obtaining secret documents. \n \nWhen the player completes a mission, his or her performance is evaluated afterward. A player's score is penalized with a lower rank and reduced heroism for excessive killing and frequently being discovered, whereas players who are stealthy and subdue enemy soldiers non-lethally will be awarded appropriately. Players can replay previously cleared missions for higher ranks. \n \nPlayers can go through missions as Snake or as an MSF soldier (male or female). Some missions will only be available to Snake, and likewise for MSF soldiers. \n \nThe game adopts certain mechanics from Metal Gear Solid 4, such as the ability to move while crouched, the over-the-shoulder shooting view, the CQC system, and the ability to search held-up soldiers. The truck from Portable Ops, where players can bring subdued enemies for recruitment, has been discarded in favor of the Fulton Recovery System, which players attach to subdued soldiers and prisoners. The Wi-Fi recruitment system from Portable Ops has been modified so that instead of tapping the Circle button to obtain a strong enough signal from an access point, the player will have to knockout soldiers using CQC to accept them. The cardboard box used to hide from enemy soldiers is now available in two-man versions called Love Boxes, which have different variants. The Surround Indicator in Portable Ops can also be used only when it is equipped in the item box and players will also develop and use an early version of the Soliton radar system from Metal Gear Solid. The game features the camouflage index system from Snake Eater, but the player does not have the ability to change camouflage uniforms during a mission as the point index will be entirely based on movement, position, and the size of the weapon equipped in the weapon box. The player can also use marking devices to call in artillery strikes or resupply drops. \n \nMovement is done on the analog stick; actions such as co-op actions use the directional-pad; melee actions, which include multiple throws into crowds of enemies, use the R button; and weapons use the L button with the R button. Players will be unable to move or shoot while lying down and while pinned on a wall. The player can set the control system according to that of Portable Ops, Guns of the Patriots, or Capcom's Monster Hunter. \n \nBefore starting a mission, the player can determine his or her character's item and weapon load-out, including the character's uniform. The player's carrying capacity is limited and any excessive items that the player obtains during a mission will be transferred over to Mother Base's inventory. There are four primary types of uniforms that can be worn by the player. \n \nJungle Fatigues \u2014 The default uniform for Snake and MSF Soldiers. A balance of stealth, defense, weapons, and inventory. Available in multiple camouflage patterns. \nNaked \u2014 A shirtless version of the Jungle Fatigues, players using Naked uniforms move fast at the cost of lower stealth, weaker defense, and fewer items. \nSneaking Suit \u2014 Resembles the sneaking suit worn by Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, it allows players to move without generating foot noises and have higher camouflage compared to other suits while moving, but restricts them to five items and six secondary weapons. \nBattle Dress \u2014 A heavily armored suit that allows the player to carry a third primary weapon and absorb heavy firepower, but at the cost of a lower item carrying capacity, slower mobility and a lower camouflage index. A variant outfitted with a helmet is also available, which increases the defenses. \n \nMother Base \nThe Mother Base is an abandoned OTEC research platform in the Caribbean that serves as the MSF's headquarters. Aside from managing the combat, medical, intelligence, and technology research teams seen in MPO, the player can assign personnel to the mess hall crew to feed the troops and keep up their morale. Rebellious or injured personnel can be brought to the brig and sickbay, respectively. The player will also have a chance to capture military vehicles that appear in the game as minor boss opponents, such as armored personnel carriers, tanks, and attack helicopters. Up to 350 soldiers can be recruited; excess staff caught in a mission must be discharged and up to 50 vehicles can be captured over the course of the game. \n \nItems and weapons are not procured on-site, but rather they're developed by MSF's R&D division based on blueprints obtained from missions. New items and weapons can only be developed when the player has sufficient GMP and certain MSF divisions have both reached the required level. Once development of an item has been completed, the R&D staff will automatically mass-produce them for the entire army. \n \nOuter Ops is a new game mechanic where players can deploy their combat unit soldiers (with the exception of Snake and other unique characters) and captured vehicles on certain missions against computer opponents. Each assault force codenamed from Alpha to Hotel has eight slots for assigning vehicles or soldiers, who can gain combat bonuses such as additional hit points and Psyche points, and generate income for the team. Depending on the scale of the enemy's firepower, MSF soldiers who are defeated during the battle can either die or be brought to sickbay for treatment. Vehicles that show damage in one mission will still show damage unless they are taken off the front for repairs, while decommissioned vehicles will be stricken from the inventory. \n \nMultiplayer \nThe Comrade System from Portable Ops has been removed in favor of a cooperative play mode called \"Co-Ops\", which allows two players to play most sneaking missions and four players in boss missions. There are several actions that can take place when two players are next to each other. 'Snake-in' allows players to hold on to each other as one player leads the way, also allowing the players to fire on the move. Other co-operative actions include holding up closing doors, performing CPR on fallen comrades, sharing items, and acting as a spotter for other players whose vision is obscured. \n \nVersus Ops are multiplayer matches played over special versions of certain maps.

These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on. \nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\". \nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events. \nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them. \nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins). \n \nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player. \nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live.", "themes": ["Action"]}, {"id": 1703, "age_ratings": 0, "aggregated_rating": 91.0, "cover": 89063, "first_release_date": "21.3.2003", "game_modes": ["Single player"], "genres": ["Sport"], "involved_companies": ["Nintendo R&D1"], "name": "WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!", "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "Wii U", "Nintendo 3DS"], "popularity": 1.668679308137144, "screenshots": [20225, 20226, 178103, 178104, 178105, 178106, 178107, 178108, 178109, 178110, 178111, 178112], "slug": "warioware-inc-mega-microgames", "summary": "Frantic action!

Experience is gained through battle and through use of skills.

Unlike those of other computer RPGs of the time, these NPCs might temporarily refuse to give up an item or perform an action if ordered to do so. The game was also noted for its high and unforgiving difficulty level and for such combat prose as \"reduced to a thin red paste\" and \"explodes like a blood sausage\", which prompted an unofficial PG-13 sticker on the game packaging in the United States. \n \nWasteland was one of the first games featuring a persistent world, where changes to the game world were stored and kept.
